# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Deploy

We have developed and tested on testnet. We need to add some tests to follow good code practices.

## mainnet

We want to audit our code, either with the Pego team or internally, before deploying it on the mainnet. All the code is ready to be deployed. All that's missing is a wallet with PEGOs. Wee are ready and wee want to continue this projet.
